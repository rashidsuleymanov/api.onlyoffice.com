If you want your plugin to be available to other users in the **ONLYOFFICE Plugin Marketplace**, suggest it for publishing:

1. Create a fork of the <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice.github.io> repository.

2. Add your plugin to this fork.

3. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice.github.io/pulls) from your fork to *https\://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice.github.io*. You can use the **Submit your own plugin** button in the Plugin Manager window.

4. If your plugin works properly, your pull request will be approved and the plugin will appear in the marketplace.
