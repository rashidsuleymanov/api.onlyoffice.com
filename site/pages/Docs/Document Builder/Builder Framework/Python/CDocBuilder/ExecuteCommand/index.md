#### def ExecuteCommand(self, command, retValue=None);

Executes the command which will be used to create the document file (text document, spreadsheet, presentation, form document, PDF). See the [Text document API](../../../../../Office%20API/Office%20API/Text%20Document%20API/index.md), [Spreadsheet API](../../../../../Office%20API/Office%20API/Spreadsheet%20API/index.md), [Presentation API](../../../../../Office%20API/Office%20API/Presentation%20API/index.md), or [Form API](../../../../../Office%20API/Office%20API/Form%20API/index.md) sections for more information which commands are available for various document types.

> Please note, that for the *.docbuilder* file the *CDocBuilder.ExecuteCommand* method is not used explicitly. The command itself is used instead. See the example below.
