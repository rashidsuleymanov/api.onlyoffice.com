## Which paths should I specify when integrating ONLYOFFICE Docs with my website?

After you download and unpack the examples for integration ONLYOFFICE Docs with your website, you need to open the source codes and replace all the instances of the **https\://documentserver/** string with the actual address of your installed ONLYOFFICE Docs.

## What settings should be used when connecting ONLYOFFICE to ownClowd/Nextcloud via a local and public network?

When connecting your ownCloud/Nextcloud installation to ONLYOFFICE Docs, you need to make sure that the server with ONLYOFFICE Docs installed is accessible both for the internet browsers and ownCloud/Nextcloud installations, i.e. the requests can be sent to and the responses can be accepted from the computer with ONLYOFFICE Docs installed.

The interaction scheme between ownCloud installation and ONLYOFFICE Docs is available [here](../../../Get%20Started/Ready-to-use%20connectors/ownCloud%20integration/index.md#configuring-owncloud-onlyoffice-integration-app). If you use Nextcloud, visit [this page](../../../Get%20Started/Ready-to-use%20connectors/Nextcloud%20integration/index.md#configuring-nextcloud-onlyoffice-integration-app) to see how you can properly set up your server.
