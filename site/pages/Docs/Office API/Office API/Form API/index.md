A form document has exactly the same structure as a [text document](../Text%20Document%20API/index.md). The only difference is a new *forms* entity placed with other paragraph elements – text runs, inline text content controls and hyperlinks. There are seven form types: *text field*, *combo box*, *dropdown list*, *checkbox*, *radio button*, *picture form*, and *complex field*.


## Creating a new form document

To create a form document, the [CreateFile](../../../Document%20Builder/Builder%20Framework/C++/CDocBuilder/CreateFile/index.md) method with the *"pdf"* extension must be used.

To save the ready document as a form, you need to use the [SaveFile](../../../Document%20Builder/Builder%20Framework/C++/CDocBuilder/SaveFile/index.md) method with the *"pdf"* extension.

The simplest example form document with a single text form containing the "John Smith" text can be built with the help of **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder** using the following code:

``` js
builder.CreateFile("pdf");                      // create a form document file in the .pdf format with ONLYOFFICE Document Builder
var oDocument = Api.GetDocument();                // create a new 'oDocument' variable and get the created text document contents
var oTextForm = Api.CreateTextForm();             // create an empty text form
var oParagraph = oDocument.GetElement(0);         // get the first empty paragraph from the created document
oParagraph.AddElement(oTextForm);                 // add the created text form to the first paragraph
oTextForm.SetText("John Smith");                  // add the "John Smith" text to the text form
builder.SaveFile("pdf", "example.pdf");           // save the resulting form document as a file in the .pdf format with the 'example.pdf' name
builder.CloseFile();                              // close the form document file and finish work with ONLYOFFICE Document Builder
```


## Opening an existing form document

If you want to edit an already existing form document, you can open it using **ONLYOFFICE Document Builder**, get its elements and change them however you need. The only difference from a document editor in this case will be that you will not need this document editor. The document is opened the following way:

``` js
builder.OpenFile("https://example.com/myformdocument.pdf");        // use a path to an existing 'myformdocument.pdf' form document file to open it with ONLYOFFICE Document Builder
var oDocument = Api.GetDocument();                // create a new 'oDocument' variable and get the created text document contents
var oTextForm = Api.CreateTextForm();             // create an empty text form
var oParagraph = oDocument.GetElement(0);         // get the first empty paragraph from the created document
oParagraph.AddElement(oTextForm);                 // add the created text form to the first paragraph
oTextForm.SetText("John Smith");                  // add the "John Smith" text to the text form
builder.SaveFile("pdf", "example.pdf");       // save the resulting form document as a file in the .pdf format with the 'example.pdf' name
builder.CloseFile();                              // close the form document file and finish work with ONLYOFFICE Document Builder
```

As you can see you just need to use the *builder.OpenFile();* method of the [CDocBuilder](../../../Document%20Builder/Builder%20Framework/C++/CDocBuilder/index.md) class with the path to the necessary form document as an argument to open it. In the above example we open **myformdocument.pdf** document, get its first paragraph and add the text form with the "John Smith" text to it. The same way any other form document element can be changed.

Use the appropriate API documentation sections to find out which methods allow you to change certain document and spreadsheet element formatting properties.
