## What plugins can do

Here are some examples of what you can do with ONLYOFFICE DocSpace plugins:

- connect third-party services, like [Draw.io](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/draw-io), [Speech to Text Conversion](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/speech-to-text), etc.;
- enhance the existing user experience and the editorsâ€™ functionality: [PDF-converter](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins/tree/master/pdf-converter).

Code samples are available at <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins>.

## How to create plugins

To create your own plugin, you need to follow a few steps:

1. Learn the fundamental concepts for building plugins on the [Getting started](../Getting%20Started/index.md) page and write code that defines the plugin appearance and behavior.
2. After creating the plugin, build it using the instructions [here](../../Plugins%20SDK/Building%20Plugin/index.md).
3. Now you can upload the plugin to the DocSpace portal and use it.
