Develop a plugin. Follow the plugin structure described [here](../Plugin%20Structure/index.md).

- Write code for each [plugin type](Plugin%20Types/index.md) using the corresponding variables, methods and [items](Plugin%20Items/index.md). Put the scripts into the *src* folder. Specify the required [Plugin](Plugin%20Types/Plugin/index.md) interface for each plugin to be embedded in the portal.

- Specify [plugin messages](Plugin%20Message/index.md) that will be returned by the items. Use the appropriate [events](Events/index.md) that will be processed on the portal side.

- Learn which [plugin components](Plugin%20Components/index.md) can be used for the DocSpace plugin interface and add them to your scripts.

Code samples are available at <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-plugins>.
